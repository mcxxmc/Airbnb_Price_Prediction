# CS542_Airbnb_Price_Prediction
This is the final project for my CS542 Machine learning class at BU in fall 2019.

# Description
The task is to predict the price of an airbnb.com listing from features extracted from the listing.

The dataset consists of features extracted from the listing (e.g., host's response time, average review score, etc.) and the listing price (per day) which is the target output. The dataset has already been split up into train, val and test sets.

data.csv includes all the features and price values. The "id" column is the unique identifier of each data point; please note that the id column is not continuous. Also note that price values for test set are removed.

train/val/test.csv includes the ids for each dataset. You can use these ids to find corresponding data in data.csv.
